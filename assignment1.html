    <h2 id="it">Purpose of IT in the modern business</h2>
    <p>Information technology (IT) has evolved over the last two decades from its traditional
        focus of administrative support (i.e. back office) to a more strategic role within
        organisations (Henderson and Venkatraman 1993). IT has become so vital in the daily
        operations of many businesses that without its’ functionalities could led to many problems
        including poor organisational performance, operational efficiencies, and missed opportunities. </p>

        <h3 id="itresources">Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
            successfully?</h3>

        <p>Planning is really crucial during the completion of a successful digital projects.
            Planning allows indiduckas to create innovative ideas - which can then later be
            modified if needed. 
            
            Web-based applications such as Trello make the planning of
            projects easier. Trello is a task management tool which allows individuals to better manage
            their projects through the use of the Kanban system enabling individuals to create
            a list of all the tasks required for a successful website. This allows individuals
            to visualise what is being worked on and who is working on it.
        <br><br>
        To build a successful project, individuals or teams need to make sure that the tasks involved
        are clearly outlined. They need to ensure that deadlines are set - so that they are not having
        to work under pressure - thus in this case, management and the ability to prioritise are
        important factors. </p>
       </div>

       <div>
           <h3>Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website. 
           How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board  </h3>
     <p>
            I plan to use a trello board to plan and management the creation of this digital project.
            Listing all the different tasks and things to do on trello will allow me to prioritise 
            which tasks I need to focus on most - through adding deadlines and colour bands. Click here to see trello board <a href="https://trello.com/b/qErEVlwj/rechos-it-blog">https://trello.com/b/qErEVlwj/rechos-it-blog.</a>
            In addition to this, drawing the layout of the pages will help when it comes to actually 
            creating the website - which is something trello does not offer.

     <h4 id="riskaffectingprojects">Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? </h4>
     <p>One of the biggest factors related to the failure of digital projects is the misalignment
         of business and IT strategy. Oftentimes, the business and IT strategy of the business are
         not aligned with each other - with usually the technology team working ahead of the
         strategy due to the hype of the innovative new technology. Therefore, it is important that
          the business and IT strategy are aligned with the overall organisational strategies in
          order develop successful business processes
     <br><br>
          Furthermore, a lack of cross-functional expertises can lead to the failure of digital projects.
          A usual misconception is the idea that the business and IT teams are working in silo.
          However, during the implementation of a digital project, they should be someone with business
         process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the business and IT
         team p which again refers to back to alignment. Without the alignment and effective communication
         of the strategies between the business and IT - projects will continue to fail.
         In fact, in a survey of 182 business and IT executives Luftman and McLean (2004)
         found alignment to be the number one management concern for many organisational executives.

          <p>
              The strategic alignment model is used to align the business and IT - in order 
              to prevent digital projects from failing.

<div>
<h5 id="itsystems">Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software - 
  how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
</h5>
<p>
      When selecting the appropriate IT systems and software for a client, it is important
      to first conduct some research on the client’s needs and requirements. Finding out what
      the client requires is important because this will enable the create the appropriate software. 
      It would also be important to research what other people have previously created and whether
      these have been successful in order to make final decisions.

  <h6>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you 
        achieve your outcomes. How has trello helped you plan and how can git and github 
        help with your code version control.
  </h6>
<p>
        Trello helped the planning of my digital project as it allowed me to better manage and prioritise tasks that I needed to complete first. However, I was not as productive with Trello as I should have been. Therefore, for future improvements, I will make sure I take the full advantage of Trello -such as, moving the tasks around from things like doing, need to do, and done. Furthermore, git and github enable me to save my work on a cloud based file system which allowed me to access it at home and different computer systems. In addition to this, git and github can be really useful for when developing a project in a team - as team members will able to open the files at different locations and make changes.

<div>
    <h6 id="gdpr">
        Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
    </h6>
<p>
    GDPR stands for general data protection regulation which is a regulation in the European Union (EU) law used for data protection and privacy for all individuals in the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). This regulation aims to protect individual’s data such as their names, contact number, addresses from being used any howly or identifiable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">[3].</a> GDPR can impact digital projects if companies are using the data collected for other reasons other than the ones specified. This is problematic because it can lead to many penalties including fines. Furthermore, GDPR can affect companies outside of the EU if their regulation does not include using individual data from the EU.

<h1>Outcome 2
</h1>
    <div id="a1o2">
     <h3>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your
            own website, are you happy with the tools you used?E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </h3>
             <p>Trello was a good tool to use during the implementation of this digital project - as it allowed me to plan, task and set deadlines. In addition to this, trello allowed me to be able to make changes and remember tasks that I had perhaps forgotten about. Another tool I used during the creation of my website was Visual Studio Code (i.e. source-code editor). This is a great tool to use when developing a website. This is because, visual studio code enables for the use of different languages (i.e. css, html) to develop a website.     
             </p>
        </div>

<div>
    <h3>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3>
<p>
        Visual studio code was definitely an appropriate IT tool to use during the development of this digital project. The reason for this is because it allows for the use of different languages within visual studio code - which makes it easier to flick through tabs and make changes when needed in both html and css. Trello was an appropriate tool to use, however, there also come some disadvantages. For example, Trello doesn’t give different layout options for projects. Some people are very visual and like to see diagrams and arrows etc on what they need to do next - which trello does not offer. Consequently, trello may get confusing when faced with many tasks that needs to be completed. As a result, trello might not be ideal to use when dealing with large projects.  
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
</h3>
<p>
        I am not completely happy with my website. The reason for this was  because I was under pressure for time to complete it. It took me some time to understand the features in HTML and CSS - and because of this, I lost out some time on actually working on my website. 
        If I were to create another website, I would make sure I make better use of trello in terms of setting tasks and making sure I follow them through. I would also make sure I do some extra research in regards to understanding the features of css and html
         
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
<p>
        Further improvements would include adding more features on my website and making everything more interactive. This can be achieved through a better understanding of the different features and buttons in both CSS and HTML.  
</p>

</div>

<div id="a1o3">
<h1>
Outcome 3
</h1>
<h3> Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h3>
<p>
        I think my use of trello could have been more efficient when making and planning for my website. Although trello allowed me to plan and managed my project better, I should managed   
</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency </h3>
<p>
<ol class="reference">
     <li>
        One way to improve efficiency is to constantly test the website to make it is working properly - this will allow you check for any occurrence of errors or faults. This will also reduce the chances of errors during the later stages of developing the website - also reducing the pressures of the overall test because you would have discovered the errors at an earlier stage. 
    </li> 
    <li>
            One way to improve productivity is through doing yoga classes when feeling stressed - as this will ease the pressures of the work and increase level of dopamine in the brain.
            Other ways to keep productive include taking regular breaks, drinking a lot of water to stay hydrated which will ultimately improve concentration levels.
    </li>        
</ol>
</p>
</div>

<div>
        <h3>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>
    <p>
            To improve my own productivity next time when develop a digital project - it would make it easier to work as a team. This will allow us to share the workload, ultimately making it easier to manage the whole project which we use trello to this as well. Furthermore, other future improvements include better planning of the project in general (i.e. layout, ideas etc), better time management, and prioritisation parts I know will take a longer time to implement. 
    </p>
    
    </div>

<div>
    <h3>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
        Continued from previous task.
     </h3>
<p>
    When testing a digital website it is important that to get feedback from users. Using feedbacks from the users testing will allow me to make changes when needed and check for links that might not be working. Moreover, it would be useful to get someone of a senior position to test the site to get their opinion - it will also be useful to get colleagues feedback.
