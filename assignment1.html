    <h2 id="it">Purpose of IT in the modern business</h2>
    <p>Information technology (IT) has evolved over the last two decades from its traditional
        focus of administrative support (i.e. back office) to a more strategic role within
        organisations (Henderson and Venkatraman 1993). IT has become so vital in the daily
        operations of many businesses that without its‚Äô functionalities could led to many problems
        including poor organisational performance, operational efficiencies, and missed opportunities. </p>

        <h3 id="IT Resources">Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects
            successfully?</h3>

        <p>Planning is really crucial during the completion of a successful digital projects.
            Planning allows indiduckas to create innovative ideas - which can then later be
            modified if needed. 
            
            Web-based applications such as Trello make the planning of
            projects easier. Trello is a task management tool which allows individuals to better manage
            their projects through the use of the Kanban system enabling individuals to create
            a list of all the tasks required for a successful website. This allows individuals
            to visualise what is being worked on and who is working on it.
        <br><br>
        To build a successful project, individuals or teams need to make sure that the tasks involved
        are clearly outlined. They need to ensure that deadlines are set - so that they are not having
        to work under pressure - thus in this case, management and the ability to prioritise are
        important factors. </p>
       </div>

       <div>
           <h3>Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website. 
           How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board  </h3>
     <p>
            I plan to use a trello board to plan and management the creation of this digital project.
            Listing all the different tasks and things to do on trello will allow me to prioritise 
            which tasks I need to focus on most - through adding deadlines and colour bands.

     <h4 class="risk affecting projects">Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? </h4>
     <p>One of the biggest factors related to the failure of digital projects is the misalignment
         of business and IT strategy. Oftentimes, the business and IT strategy of the business are
         not aligned with each other - with usually the technology team working ahead of the
         strategy due to the hype of the innovative new technology. Therefore, it is important that
          the business and IT strategy are aligned with the overall organisational strategies in
          order develop successful business processes
     <br><br>
          Furthermore, a lack of cross-functional expertises can lead to the failure of digital projects.
          A usual misconception is the idea that the business and IT teams are working in silo.
          However, during the implementation of a digital project, they should be someone with business
         process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the business and IT
         team p which again refers to back to alignment. Without the alignment and effective communication
         of the strategies between the business and IT - projects will continue to fail.
         In fact, in a survey of 182 business and IT executives Luftman and McLean (2004)
         found alignment to be the number one management concern for many organisational executives.

              The strategic alignment model is used to align the business and IT - in order 
              to prevent digital projects from failing.

<h5>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software - 
  how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
</h5>
<p>
      When selecting the appropriate IT systems and software for a client, it is important
      to first conduct some research on the client‚Äôs needs and requirements. Finding out what
      the client requires is important because this will enable the create the appropriate software. 
      It would also be important to research what other people have previously created and whether
      these have been successful in order to make final decisions.
