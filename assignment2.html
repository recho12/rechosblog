    <p>
    <ol class="layout">
    <li>
    Font size - the font size will vary from the main heading to the sub titles. The heading will be in a bigger size than the rest of the words. All the sub titles for the different paragraphs will be in the same size including the paragraphs.
    </li>
   <li>
       Font colour - this will be vary. I will use colours that will stand to ensure the website is accessiable for people with visibility needs. 
   </li>

   <li>
       Navigation - I will use navigation bars and jump links to ensure users can jump straight the pages they want instead of having to keep scrolling.
     </li>
     <li>
    Images - I will use images to demonstrate main points and also to make the website look more interative.   
     </li>
    <li>
      Background colour - I have choosen a grey background - the reason for this is because - it is colour freely and makes the text stand out.  
    </li>

    <li>
       Layout - I centralised the layout of my page to make it easy on the eye and for people with special needs for example, people with dyslexia, epilepsy and many others.

          Colour - the choice of colour is really important in overcome issues for people with disabilities. Developers need to make sure they select appropriate colours which will contrast well with the background of the page.
