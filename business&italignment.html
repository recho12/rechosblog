       <h4 class="risk affecting projects"> Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? </h4>
       <p>One of the biggest factors related to the failure of digital projects is the misalignment
           of business and IT strategy. Oftentimes, the business and IT strategy of the business are
           not aligned with each other - with usually the technology team working ahead of the
           strategy due to the hype of the innovative new technology. Therefore, it is important that
            the business and IT strategy are aligned with the overall organisational strategies in
            order develop successful business processes
       <br><br>
            Furthermore, a lack of cross-functional expertises can lead to the failure of digital projects.
            A usual misconception is the idea that the business and IT teams are working in silo.
            However, during the implementation of a digital project, they should be someone with business
           process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the business and IT
           team p which again refers to back to alignment. Without the alignment and effective communication
           of the strategies between the business and IT - projects will continue to fail.
           In fact, in a survey of 182 business and IT executives Luftman and McLean (2004)
           found alignment to be the number one management concern for many organisational executives.

                The strategic alignment model is used to align the business and IT - in order 
                to prevent digital projects from failing.

    Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software - 
    how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
</h5>
<p>
        When selecting the appropriate IT systems and software for a client, it is important
        to first conduct some research on the client‚Äôs needs and requirements. Finding out what
        the client requires is important because this will enable the create the appropriate software. 
        It would also be important to research what other people have previously created and whether
        these have been successful in order to make final decisions.
